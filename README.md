# Project – Caesar Cipher

This repository contains the very first project in the first module of the Basic Ruby Projects curriculum. The project is based on Caesar's Cipher encryption, a classic technique in cryptography. It works by substituting each letter in a text file with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to implement a Caesar cipher that takes in a string and a shift factor, and then outputs the modified string using a right shift.

## Features to Implement

- [ ] Create your own method called caesar_cipher.
- [ ] Apply two parameters called message, and shifter.
- [ ] The first method 'message' returns a string output.
- [ ] The second method 'shifter' returns a number output.
- [ ] Ensure the text and the message output both at the same time.
- [ ] Keep the text output the same casing.

## Example Usage

Here is an example of Caesar Cipher encryption in practice:

```ruby
  caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  → "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```
