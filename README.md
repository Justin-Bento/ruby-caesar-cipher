# Basic Ruby Projects

This repository contains the very first project in the first module of the Basic Ruby Projects curriculum. The project is based on Caesar's Cipher encryption, a classic technique in cryptography. It works by substituting each letter in a text file with another letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet

The goal of this project is to implement a Caesar cipher that takes in a string and a shift factor, and then outputs the modified string using a right shift.

Here is an example of Caesar Cipher encryption in practice:

```ruby
  caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
  â†’ "Bmfy f xywnsl!"
```

## Project Goals

[ ] Create your own method called caesar_cipher.

[ ] Apply two paramaters called message, and shifter.

[ ] The first method 'message' returns a string outpt.

[ ] The second method 'shifter' returns a number outpt.

[ ] Ensure the text and the message output both at the same time.

[ ] Keep the text output the same casing.
