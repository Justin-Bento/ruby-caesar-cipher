# → [] Create your own method called caesar_cipher.
# → [] Apply two paramaters called message, and shifter.
  # → [] The first method 'message' returns a string outpt.
  # → [] The second method 'shifter' returns a number outpt.
# → [] Ensure the text and the message output both at the same time.
  # → [] Keep the text output the same casing.
